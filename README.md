# Gotas

Gotas is a [task server](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskserver/) Go implementation.

If we already have a mature and fully functional (and official) implementation, why reinvent the wheel then? I've got 
two main purposes, the first one is to continue learning Go, and a good way to archive it is by doing real-world 
projects.  I'm a [Task Warrior](https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/) user and fan, and hence I'll doing 
something useful at least for my personal use.  The second reason is that I think it could be interesting to have a 
multiplatform task server that doesn't have any 3rd party libraries dependency.
